# sysdig-k3sblog

This is an accompanying repo from a k3s blog we created to help you deploy not only K3s but Sysdig as well.

we have attached some scripts to:

1) Deploy a 3 node cluster in 1) AWS or 2) GCP or 3) Packet via terraform
2) a script using k3sup to install k3s on the 3 nodes we created
